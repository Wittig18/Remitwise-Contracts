// Issue #887 — safe-math wrapper tests for `savings_goals`.
//
// # Coverage
//
// `add_to_goal` — checked_add path
// ──────────────────────────────────
// `add_to_goal` internally computes:
//   `new_total = goal.current_amount.checked_add(amount)`
// A `None` result (i128 wrap) returns `SavingsGoalError::Overflow`.
// Additionally, if `current_amount > MAX_SAFE_GOAL_BALANCE (i128::MAX/2)` the
// contract returns `SavingsGoalError::Overflow` as a secondary safety guard.
//
// `withdraw_from_goal` — checked_sub path
// ────────────────────────────────────────
// `withdraw_from_goal` internally computes:
//   `goal.current_amount.checked_sub(amount).ok_or(SavingsGoalError::Overflow)`
// Withdrawing more than the balance causes checked_sub to return None, which
// maps to `SavingsGoalError::Overflow` (underflow guard).
// Attempting to withdraw when the balance would go negative maps to
// `SavingsGoalError::InsufficientBalance` via the pre-check.
//
// Tests verify:
//   • Happy path — normal additions and withdrawals succeed with correct totals.
//   • checked_add overflow — adding beyond MAX_SAFE_GOAL_BALANCE → Overflow.
//   • checked_sub underflow — withdrawing more than balance → returns error.
//   • Zero and negative amounts — rejected with InvalidAmount.
//   • Determinism — identical sequences produce identical results.
//
// All tests are deterministic.  No std:: in non-test paths.
